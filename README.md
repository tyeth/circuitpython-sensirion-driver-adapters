# Sensirion Drvier Adapters

This repository contains adapter classes that can be used to separate the
logic of packaging user data into a byte stream and using that byte
stream in different channels. 
The classes can be used as adapters to the *sensirion_i2c_driver.I2cConnection* and 
*sensirion_shdlc_driver.ShdlcSerialPort*.

The python package circuitpython-sensirion-driver-adapters replaces the package sensirion-i2c-adapter. The latter is deprecated and
will no longer be maintained. All functionality of sensirion-i2c-adapter is contained within the package
circuitpython-sensirion-driver-adapters.

## Usage

See package description in [README.rst](README.rst) and user manual at
https://sensirion.github.io/python-driver-adapters/.

## Development

We develop and test this driver using our company internal tools (version
control, continuous integration, code review etc.) and automatically
synchronize the `master` branch with GitHub. But this doesn't mean that we
don't respond to issues or don't accept pull requests on GitHub. In fact,
you're very welcome to open issues or create pull requests :)
